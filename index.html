        <p> <b>Step 3:</b>
            With the gridle set to low-medium heat, place the butter side down onto the griddle.
        </p>
        <p> <small> <strong> NOTE: </strong> If you don't hear sizzling, it means your pan isn't hot enough.</small></p>

        Flip the Grilled Cheese onto the other side after 3-4 minutes or until golden brown.
